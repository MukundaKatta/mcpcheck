    summary: "Config failed to parse even after stripping comments and trailing commas.",
    details: `mcpcheck first tries to parse the file as JSONC (JSON with \`//\` and \`/* */\` comments and trailing commas — what Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code actually accept). If that still fails, the file is reported as \`invalid-json\` and every other rule is skipped for that file.

**Fix:** open the file and check the line number in the error message. Common culprits are unescaped backslashes in Windows paths (\`"C:\\Users..."\` must be \`"C:\\\\Users..."\`) and stray commas between top-level keys.`,

**Fix:** add one of the two. If you meant to disable the entry, set \`"disabled": true\` instead of leaving it transport-less.`,

    autofix: false,
    summary: "Both \`command\` and \`url\` are set, or \`transport\` disagrees with them.",
    details: `MCP supports stdio (local process) and http/sse (remote). Setting both \`command\` and \`url\` on the same server makes the client pick one, and different clients pick differently. Setting \`"transport": "sse"\` while also setting \`command\` is the same problem in a louder voice.

**Fix:** remove whichever field doesn't match your intent.`,

    details: `Your MCP config is often committed to a repo, synced across machines, or pasted into docs. Hardcoded API keys in \`env\` values are a common source of leaks.

mcpcheck matches on format (prefix + length + charset), so the check runs offline and does not talk to any provider.

**Fix:** either run \`mcpcheck --fix\`, which replaces the value with \`"\${VAR_NAME}"\` (MCP clients expand that from the shell at launch), or remove the value and export the variable in your shell profile.`,

    summary: "\`transport\` must be one of \`stdio\`, \`sse\`, \`streamable-http\`.",
    details: `Clients that look at \`transport\` use it to pick the transport implementation. Values outside the set silently get ignored or fall back to \`stdio\`, and you then get "the server isn't responding" with no better hint.

**Fix:** pick one of the supported values, or delete the field and let the client infer it from \`command\` vs \`url\`.`,

    details: `Not necessarily a bug — Claude Code's \`~/.claude.json\` holds other state too — but very often the sign of a file that was partially edited or a key that got typo'd.

**Fix:** add servers, or disable the rule for files you know don't carry a server map.`,

    details: `Most MCP servers are distributed via \`npx\`, \`uvx\`, or \`docker\`. Running them unpinned means you get whatever the registry says is latest on every launch, which is how configs that worked yesterday start failing tomorrow (and how supply-chain attacks get delivered).

**Fix:** pin the exact version: \`npx -y @org/pkg@1.2.3\`, \`uvx pkg==1.2.3\`, \`docker run image:1.2.3\` (explicit tag, not \`:latest\` and not implicit).`,

    summary: "A URL-transport server targets an https endpoint but declares no `Authorization` header.",
    details: `Most remote MCP servers require a bearer token or similar auth. A config with an https URL and no \`Authorization\` is almost always a missed env substitution — the user meant to add \`"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer \${API_TOKEN}" }\` and forgot.

Plain-http local endpoints are handled separately by the \`invalid-url\` rule (http to non-localhost is already flagged). Real public no-auth endpoints exist — mock servers, open-data servers — so this defaults to warning rather than error.

**Fix:** add a headers block with the substituted token, or disable the rule for this server if the endpoint really is open.`,

    details: `That token rides over the wire in cleartext; any on-path attacker sees it. \`invalid-url\` warns about plain http to non-local hosts in general; this rule fires only on the unambiguously-bad case where a credential is also being sent.

**Fix:** switch the URL scheme to https (or drop the credential header if the server really is open).`,

    summary: "An `env` entry has value `\"\"`.",
    details: `Setting \`"API_KEY": ""\` is not the same as omitting the key: the variable still exists in the subprocess's environment with value \`""\`. Libraries that check \`if (VAR)\` treat it as absent; libraries that check \`if (VAR !== undefined)\` see it as set. The resulting inconsistency is painful to debug.

**Fix:** either set the real value (often \`"\${VAR}"\` substitution), or remove the key entirely.`,
  },
  {
    id: "invalid-env-var-name",
    title: "Env var name isn't POSIX-portable",

    summary: "An env var name doesn't match `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*`.",
    details: `Mixed case, hyphens, or leading digits work in some shells and trip others. Node and Python accept pretty much anything; plain \`/bin/sh\` and a handful of smaller clients don't.

**Fix:** rename to ALL_CAPS. If you rely on a specific casing for a third-party client, disable the rule for that server.`,

    defaultSeverity: "error",

    summary: "An `env` value looks like template text (`YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`, `<token>`, `xxx…`, `replace-me`, `TODO`).",
    details: `The config was probably pasted from a README and never completed. These values don't trigger \`hardcoded-secret\` (wrong format) and cause a confusing runtime failure at launch rather than at lint time.

**Fix:** replace with the real value, or (usually what you want) \`\${VAR}\` substitution.`,

    details: `\`npx\` without a package, \`uvx\` without a package, \`docker\` without a subcommand, or \`bash\` without a script each exit with help text rather than running anything. Nine times in ten, \`args: []\` is a half-edited config — the user meant to add a package or subcommand and didn't.

**Fix:** either fill in the missing args or remove the key entirely (omitting \`args\` is different from setting it to \`[]\`).`,

    summary: "An `npx` / `uvx` package name is within edit distance 3 of an official `@modelcontextprotocol/*` server but doesn't match it.",
    details: `Typosquatted npm packages are a real supply-chain attack vector — registering \`@modelcontextprotoco/server-filesystem\` (missing a letter) is a one-day project for a motivated attacker and mcpcheck's other rules won't catch it.

The rule keeps a short, curated list of well-known official MCP servers and flags invocations that *almost* match. It won't complain about legitimate third-party servers; it only fires when the name is suspiciously close to a marquee upstream.

**Fix:** check the real package name against the [official list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers). If you meant the upstream, fix the spelling.`,

  {
    id: "shell-metachars",
    title: "Shell metacharacters without a shell",
    defaultSeverity: "error",
    autofix: false,
    summary: "`command` contains `|`, `;`, `$(…)`, backticks, `&&`, `||`, `&`, or `$VAR` but isn't a shell.",
    details: `MCP clients hand \`command + args\` straight to the OS process launcher — they do not invoke a shell. So \`"command": "curl foo | sh"\` runs \`curl\` with \`foo\`, \`|\`, and \`sh\` as literal argv. The pipe is a harmless string as far as curl is concerned, and the user's actual intent never happens.

If you need a shell pipeline, wrap the whole thing in \`bash -c "…"\` (and then expect \`dangerous-command\` to look at it hard).

**Fix:** either remove the shell metacharacters, or change \`command\` to \`bash\` / \`sh\` and put the pipeline in \`args[1]\` after \`-c\`.`,

    summary: "Two entries in `env` differ only by case (e.g. `API_KEY` and `ApiKey`).",
    details: `POSIX env vars are case-sensitive at the OS level, so the MCP client hands both variables to the subprocess. Whichever one the subprocess actually reads wins; the other is silently ignored. That's almost always a typo or a copy-paste leftover.

**Fix:** delete whichever entry is the mistake.`,

    autofix: false,
    summary: "Config instructs the client to execute \`curl | sh\`, \`sudo\`, \`docker --privileged\`, \`-v /:/\`, or similar.",
    details: `An MCP config is a latent instruction: the client runs it every time it starts. Configs that fetch-and-pipe into a shell, escalate privilege, or mount the host root into a container effectively hand your machine to whatever is on the other end.

The rule flags:

- Privilege-escalation wrappers: \`sudo\`, \`doas\`, \`pkexec\`, \`runas\`, \`gosu\`, \`su\`.
- "Run as root" flags: \`--unsafe-perm\`, \`--allow-root\`, \`--allow-run-as-root\`.
- Remote-shell pipes: any argv that contains both a fetcher (\`curl\`, \`wget\`, \`iwr\`, \`Invoke-WebRequest\`) and a shell sink (\`| sh\`, \`| bash\`, \`| zsh\`, \`| pwsh\`, \`| iex\`).
- Docker \`--privileged\`.
- Docker volumes that mount the host root: \`-v /:/anything\`, \`--mount source=/,...\`.
- A literal \`rm -rf /\` sequence anywhere in \`args\`.

**Fix:** don't do any of these. If the upstream server really needs extra privilege, wrap it in a small setuid helper that you audit once, and point the config at that helper.`,
